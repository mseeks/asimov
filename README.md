# asimov(http://github.com/msull92/asimov)

A self-excercise to implement a bot that can learn word relations from mass text input and then be able to construct sentences.

### Status

This project has been very interesting and it is in it's early stages. It is not working completely, however it can make some creepily correct sentences. The major problem being, however, that it goes into loops around "pivot" words, like 'the','a', and 'it.'
